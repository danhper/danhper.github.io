# Smart Contract Example

```solidity
contract Coin {
  address public minter;
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  constructor() public { minter = msg.sender; }

  function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == minter);
    require(amount < 1e60);
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }

  function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }
}
```

# What can/cannot Smart Contracts do?

## Can

* Perform pretty much any computation
* Persist data (e.g. balance of users)
* Transfer money to other addresses or contracts

## Cannot

* Interact with anything outside of the blockchain
* Be scheduled to do something periodically

---

# Flow to use a Smart Contract

1. Write high-level code for the contract
2. Test the contract
3. Compile the contract into bytecode
4. Send a transaction to deploy the contract
5. Interact with the contract by sending transactions
   to the generated address

---

# How Smart Contracts are executed

We want to execute smart contract at address A

* User sends a transaction to address A
* Transaction is broadcasted in the same way as other transactions
* Miner executes the smart contract at address A
* If execution succeeds, new state is computed
* When receiving the block containing the transaction,
  other nodes re-execute smart contract at address A

---

# A few issues

How do we make sure that

* Execution terminates
* Users do not use too much storage
* Execution on different machines always yields the same result

# Ethereum Virtual Machine

---

# Ethereum Virtual Machine overview

.tight-list[
* Stack-based virtual machine
* Very low-level
  * No functions/block, only jumps
  * No types
* Has regular VM instructions
  * `ADD`, `SUB`, `PUSH`, `POP`
* Has instructions to interact with environment
  * `SENDER`, `CALL`, `BALANCE`
* Has both ephemeral and permanent storage
* Uses 256-bits words
]

---

# EVM Bytecode

.small-margin[
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}
```

.text.minor[will look something like]

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store 0 at position 0 in memory (loop counter)
JUMPDEST      ; set a place to jump (PC = 6)
PUSH1 0x0a    ; push 10 on the stack
PUSH1 0x00
MLOAD         ; load loop counter
PUSH1 0x01
ADD           ; increment loop counter
DUP1
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store updated loop counter
LT            ; check if loop counter is less than 10
PUSH1 0x06
JUMPI         ; jump to position 6 if true
```

# Metering

Ethereum uses the concept of *gas*

* Transactions have a base gas cost
* Each instruction costs a given amount of gas to execute
* Transactions have a gas budget to execute
* Blocks have a total gas budget

Gas has two main purposes

* Protect against DoS attacks
* Incentivize miners

---

# Gas computation

Back to the previous example

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
JUMPDEST      ; 1 gas
PUSH1 0x0a    ; 3 gas 
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas 
MLOAD         ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x01    ; 3 gas
ADD           ; 3 gas
DUP1          ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
LT            ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x06    ; 3 gas
JUMPI         ; 10 gas
```

Total 410 gas: 10 for first 4 instructions, then 40 x 10

---

# Gas computation: special cases

Some instructions, have special rules.
For example, `SSTORE` rules are:

* If allocate storage: 20,000
* If modify allocated storage: 5,000
* If free storage: -15,000


```x86asm
PUSH 0x01
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; allocate: 20,000 gas
PUSH 0x02
PUSH 0x00 
SSTORE    ; modify: 5,000 gas
PUSH 0x00
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; free: -15,000 gas
```

---

# Gas and incentives

Miners are rewarded proportionally
to the amount of gas each transaction consumes.

* Transaction senders set a *gas price*
  * Amount of money/gas that the sender is ready to pay
  * Miners are incentivized to include transactions with higher gas price
* Miners receive gas used &times; gas price for each transaction in the mined block
  * If gas budget is not fully used, gas left is returned to sender
  * If execution fails, the gas used is not returned

# Ethereum Smart Contract Programming

---

# Solidity

* High-level language targeting the EVM
* Looks vaguely like JavaScript
* Strongly typed, with a fairly simple type-system
* Contains smart contract related primitives
* Supports multiple inheritance

---

# Solidity Example

```solidity
contract Coin {
  address public minter;
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  constructor() public { minter = msg.sender; }

  function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == minter);
    require(amount < 1e60);
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }

  function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }
}
```

# Compiling Smart Contracts: functions

.pull-left-50[
* EVM bytecode has no concept of functions, only conditional jumps
* Solidity creates a conditional jump for each function
* Solidity uses function signatures to choose which function to call
* Transaction sent to the contract must contain the necessary data to trigger the function
]

.pull-right-50.small-margin.text.minor[
Sample signature
```solidity
claimFunds(address receiver)
```

Conditional jumps
```x86asm
CALLDATASIZE      ; load data size
ISZERO
PUSH2 0x00c4      ; default function location
JUMPI
CALLDATALOAD      ; load data
DUP1
PUSH4 0x24600fc3  ; function signature hash
EQ
PUSH2 0x00db      ; function location
JUMPI
DUP1
PUSH4 0x30b67baa
EQ
PUSH2 0x00e6
JUMPI
```
]

---

# Compiling Smart Contracts: types

* EVM only has 256 bit words
* Solidity has a simple type system including
  * integer types
  * data structures (lists, maps)
* Integer types are encoded using bitwise operations  
  e.g. `uint8`: `uint256 & 0xff`
* Data structures are encoded using hash  
  e.g. `key(list[5]) = keccak256(index(list) . 5)`

---

# Installing software

## NodeJS (if not already installed)

Follow instructions at: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

## Truffle

```
npm install -g truffle
```

---

# What we will build

A simple token compliant with the [ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)

This is how most "coins" or "tokens" are implemented on Ethereum.
It defines a common interface to

* Transfer tokens
* Allow other parties to transfer tokens
* Check balance for tokens
* Emit events for token transfers

---

# ERC-20 interface

```solidity
// Returns the total supply of tokens
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)

// Returns the balance of `_owner`
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)

// Transfers `_value` from sender to `_to`
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

// Transfers `_value` from `_from` to `_to` if `_from` authorized the send
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

// Approves `_spender` to spend `_value` in behalf of the sender
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

// Returns how much `_spender` is allowed to spend in behalf of `_owner`
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)

// Is emitted when `_from` transfers `_value` to `_to`
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
// Is emitted when `_owner` allows `_spender` to spend `_value` on his behalf
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

---

# Token specifics

We will build a very simple token:

* Fixed total supply (1,000,000 for the sake of example)
  * No tokens can be created or burned after creation
* All tokens belong to owner at contract creation time
* No other particular limitation

---

# Starting to develop

Start a new project

```
mkdir my-token
cd my-token
truffle init
truffle create contract MyToken
```

Create migration file: .text.minor[`migrations/2_my_token.js`]

```javascript
const MyToken = artifacts.require("MyToken");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(MyToken);
};
```

---
