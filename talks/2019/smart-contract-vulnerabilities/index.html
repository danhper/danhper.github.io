# Background
## A word about smart contracts and potential vulnerabilities


---

# Ethereum Smart Contracts

.pull-left-40[
.spaced-list[
* Programs deployed on the Ethereum blockchain
* Usually written in Solidity, compiled into EVM bytecode
* Can transfer money to other addresses (including contracts)
* Each instruction execution consumes gas
]
]

.pull-right-60[![Smart Contracts](./smart-contracts.png)]

---

# Solidity

.pull-left-40[
* High-level language targeting the EVM

* Looks vaguely like JavaScript

* Strongly typed, with a fairly simple type-system

* Contains smart contract related primitives
]

.pull-right-60[
```solidity
// Contract allowing a single address to create coins
contract Coin {
  address public minter;
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  constructor() public { minter = msg.sender; }

  function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == minter);
    require(amount < 1e60);
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }

  function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }
}
```

# Ethereum Virtual Machine

.pull-left-70[
* Stack-based virtual machine
* Very low-level
  * No functions/block, only jumps
  * No types
* Contains a lot of common instructions
  * `ADD`, `SUB`, `PUSH`, `POP`
* Contains instructions to interact with environment
  * `SENDER`, `CALL`, `BALANCE`
* Has 2 types of storage
  * Ephemeral storage: Memory
  * Permanent storage: Storage
* Uses 256-bits words
]

# Smart Contracts: What could go wrong?

.pull-left-50[
## TheDAO hack (2016)

.spaced-list[
* TheDAO raised *~$150M in ICO*
* Soon after, it got hacked *~$50M*
* Price of Ether halved
* Ethereum community decided to hard-fork
* Attacker used a *re-entrancy* vulnerability
]
]

.pull-left-50[
## Parity Wallet bug (2017)

.spaced-list[
* Parity wallet library was used to manage multisig wallet contracts
* Parity *wallet* has been *removed* due to a "bug"
* *Dependent contracts* became unable to send funds
* Around *$280M frozen*
]
]

---

# Common vulnerabilities / bugs

.spaced-list[
* Re-entrancy
  * Can allow an attacker to drain funds
* Unhandled exceptions
  * Can result in lost funds
* Dependency on destructed contract
  * Can result in locked funds
* Transaction order dependency
  * Can allow an attacker to manipulate prices
* Integer overflow
  * Can result in locked fund
]

---

# Re-entrancy

.pull-left-50[
* Vulnerable contract sends money before updating state

* Attacker contract’s fallback function is called

* Attacker contract makes re-entrant call to attacker
]


.pull-right-50[
```solidity
function payMe(address account) public {
  uint amount = getAmount(account);
  // XXX: vulnerable
  if (!account.send(amount))
    throw;
  balance[account] -= amount;
}
```
.caption[

]

```solidity
function () {
  victim.payMe(owner);
}
```
.caption[

]

]

---

# Unhandled exception

.pull-left-50[
* In Solidity, not all failed "calls" raise an exception

* If the failed call returns a boolean, it must be checked correctly

* Failure to do this could result in inconsistent state or even locked funds
]

.pull-right-50[
.middle-block[
```solidity
// allows user to withdraw funds
function withdraw(address account) public {
  uint amount = getAmount(account);
  balance[account] -= amount;
  account.send(amount); // could silently fail
}
```
.caption[

]
]
]

---

# Dependency on destructed contract

.pull-left-40[
* Contracts can use other contracts as library

* If the library contract gets destructed, the call becomes a no-op

* If the only way for a contract to send money is to use the library,
Ether can be locked
]


.pull-right-60[
```solidity
function sendEther(address recipient,
                   uint value) public onlyOwner {
  address.send(value)
}
```
.caption[

```solidity
address public library = 0xdcc703c0E500B653Ca82273B7BFAd8045D85a470;
function sendEther(address recipient,
                   uint value) public onlyOwner {
  bytes4 sig =  bytes4(sha3("sendEther(address, uint)"));
  library.delegatecall(sig, recipient, value);
}
```

# Transaction Order Dependency

.pull-left-50[
* Result can change depending on the order of the transactions

* Miners are free to choose the miner order of the transactions in a block

* There can be financial incentives to perform such manipulations
]

.pull-right-50[
```solidity
function solve() {
  if (msg.sender == owner) {// update reward
    owner.send(reward);
    reward = msg.value;
  } else if (puzzleSolved(msg.data)) {
    msg.sender.send(reward); //send reward
    solution = msg.data;
  }
}
```
.caption[

# Integer Overflow

.pull-left-50[
.spaced-list[
* Solidity has many different numeric types
  * `int8` to `int256` and `uint8` to `uint256`
* Types are encoded in EVM using bit manipulations
  * If `a` is `uint8`, a `AND a 0xff` would be generated
* Variables may therefore overflow or underflow during execution
]
]

.pull-right-40[
.middle-block[
```solidity
function overflow(uint fee) {
  uint amount = 100;

  // underflows if fee > 100
  amount -= fee;

  // tries to send a large value
  // and fails on underflow
  msg.sender.send(amount);
}
```

# Smart Contract analysis tools

.pull-left-40[
* Usually static analysis and/or symbolic execution

* Work either on Solidity or on the EVM bytecode

* Check for known vulnerabilities/patterns
]

# Smart Contract exploitation

.pull-left-50[
## According to analysis tools

* Thousands of vulnerable contracts

* Hundreds of millions USD at risk
]

.pull-right-50[
## In the real-world

* TheDAO and Parity wallet bug were impressive

* Otherwise, a few attacks here and there
]

<br>

⇒ We analyze the Ethereum blockchain to look for *actual exploitation*

# Checking for re-entrancy

1. Record all calls

2. Check for mutually recursive calls between contracts

reentrant_call(A, B) :- call_flow(A, B),

# Checking for unhandled exceptions

# Checking for dependency on destructed contract

1. Find `DELEGATECALL` instructions

2. Check the program counter after the call

3. If the PC was incremented by 1, the call was a no-op

```prolog
empty_delegate(A) :- call_entry(V, A),
                     call_exit(V, V2),

```

# Checking for transaction order dependency

1. Find transactions in the same block

2. Check if two calls read and write to the same storage key

```prolog
tod(Block, Tx, Tx2, Idx) :-
          tx_sstore(Block, Tx, Idx),
          tx_sload(Block, Tx2, Idx),
          Tx != Tx2.

    solution = msg.data;
  }

# Checking for integer overflow

.pull-left-60[
1. Infer variable types from bytecode
   * `SIGNEXTEND` means the variable is signed
   * `AND n 0xff` means it is a `uint8`

2. Compare typed and untyped results

<br>
**The approach can lead to some false-positives**

# Takeaways and conclusions

---

# Takeaways

* .bold[Re-entrancy] seems to be the *most dangerous* issue. Good target for static analysis. Better prevention at the EVM level could be helpful.

* .bold[Unhandled] exceptions is *handled well enough* by current tooling.

* .bold[Dependency on destructed contract] is mostly a *non-issue*.

* .bold[Transactions order dependency] seems to be very rare in practice

* .bold[Integer overflow] is hard to prevent and consequences *hard to predict*. Also good target for static analysis.

# Contracts wealth distribution

.pull-left-50[
* Combined value: *~2 million ETH*

* Only *~2,000* out of 21,270 contracts *held Ether*

* Less than 100 contracts had more than 10 Ether

* The *top 6 contracts held 83%* of the total Ether
]

# Vulnerable but not exploitable

.pull-left-50[
* Many cases where "vulnerable" contracts are not exploitable

* High-value contracts flagged vulnerable are typically not exploitable

* Usually limitation due to the nature of static analysis
]

.pull-right-50[
```solidity
function removeOwner(address owner) onlyWallet {
  isOwner[owner] = false;
  // Could in Theory run out of gas
  for (uint i=0; i<owners.length - 1; i++) {
    if (owners[i] == owner) {
      owners[i] = owners[owners.length - 1];
      break;

  // a bit more logic

# Summary

* Analyzed 21k contracts with *3M Ether at risk*

* *At most 0.3%* of this Ether, less than 10k ETH, was *exploited*

* Overall, *high-value contracts* seem to be quite *secure*
