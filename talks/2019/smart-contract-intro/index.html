# Long Before Smart Contracts
## Bitcoin Scripting 

---

# Bitcoin Scripting

.pull-left-50[
.spaced-list[
* Bitcoin uses a scripting language
  * Stack-based
  * Has conditional jump
  * Not Turing-complete (no loop)
* Mostly used to define how to spend Bitcoins
* Transaction is invalid if script fails
]
]

.pull-right-50[
```x86asm
OP_2
41 ; push 65 bytes
PUBKEY1

PUBKEY3
OP_3
OP_CHECKMULTISIG
```

# Bitcoin Scripting and UTXO

.pull-left-50[
* Bitcoin follows an UTXO model
* Bitcoin uses "redeem scripts" to enable scripting with UTXO
  * Only a hash of the script is published beforehand
  * Full scripts are published when spending
]

.pull-right-50[

# Flow of a Bitcoin redeem script

1. Write script
2. Hash script to create address
3. Receive Bitcoins
4. Publish script and required data (usually signature) using a transaction

---

# From Bitcoin Scripting to Smart Contracts

We need more features to write general programs

--

* Persistent state  
  &rarr; account-based  
  &rarr; storage primitives
* Turing-completeness (loops)  
  &rarr; jump primitive
* More transparency?  
  &rarr; code deployed before usage

# Smart Contracts

.pull-left-50[
* Programs deployed on a blockchain
* Usually written in a high-level language and compiled into bytecode
* Interacted with using transactions
* Uses some metering mechanism

# Smart Contract Example

```solidity
contract Coin {
  address public minter;
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  constructor() public { minter = msg.sender; }

  function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == minter);
    require(amount < 1e60);
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }

  function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }
}
```

# What can/cannot Smart Contracts do?

## Can

* Perform pretty much any computation
* Persist data (e.g. balance of users)
* Transfer money to other addresses or contracts

## Cannot

* Interact with anything outside of the blockchain
* Be scheduled to do something periodically

---

# Flow to use a Smart Contract

1. Write high-level code for the contract
2. Test the contract
3. Compile the contract into bytecode
4. Send a transaction to deploy the contract
5. Interact with the contract by sending transactions
   to the generated address

---

# How Smart Contracts are executed

We want to execute smart contract at address A

* User sends a transaction to address A
* Transaction is broadcasted in the same way as other transactions
* Miner executes the smart contract at address A
* If execution succeeds, new state is computed
* When receiving the block containing the transaction,
  other nodes re-execute smart contract at address A

---

# A few issues

How do we make sure that

* Execution terminates
* Users do not use too much storage
* Execution on different machines always yields the same result

---

# Ethereum Virtual Machine

---

# Ethereum Virtual Machine overview

.tight-list[
* Stack-based virtual machine
* Very low-level
  * No functions/block, only jumps
  * No types
* Has regular VM instructions
  * `ADD`, `SUB`, `PUSH`, `POP`
* Has instructions to interact with environment
  * `SENDER`, `CALL`, `BALANCE`
* Has both ephemeral and permanent storage
* Uses 256-bits words
]

---

# EVM Bytecode

.small-margin[
```solidity
for (uint i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}
```

.text.minor[will look something like]

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store 0 at position 0 in memory (loop counter)
JUMPDEST      ; set a place to jump (PC = 6)
PUSH1 0x0a    ; push 10 on the stack
PUSH1 0x00
MLOAD         ; load loop counter
PUSH1 0x01
ADD           ; increment loop counter
DUP1
PUSH1 0x00
MSTORE        ; store updated loop counter
LT            ; check if loop counter is less than 10
PUSH1 0x06
JUMPI         ; jump to position 6 if true
```

# Metering

Ethereum uses the concept of *gas*

* Transactions have a base gas cost
* Each instruction costs a given amount of gas to execute
* Transactions have a gas budget to execute
* Blocks have a total gas budget

Gas has two main purposes

* Protect against DoS attacks
* Incentivize miners

---

# Gas computation

Back to the previous example

```x86asm
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
JUMPDEST      ; 1 gas
PUSH1 0x0a    ; 3 gas 
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas 
MLOAD         ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x01    ; 3 gas
ADD           ; 3 gas
DUP1          ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x00    ; 3 gas
MSTORE        ; 3 gas
LT            ; 3 gas
PUSH1 0x06    ; 3 gas
JUMPI         ; 10 gas
```

Total 410 gas: 10 for first 4 instructions, then 40 x 10

---

# Gas computation: special cases

Some instructions, have special rules.
For example, `SSTORE` rules are:

* If allocate storage: 20,000
* If modify allocated storage: 5,000
* If free storage: -15,000


```x86asm
PUSH 0x01
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; allocate: 20,000 gas
PUSH 0x02
PUSH 0x00 
SSTORE    ; modify: 5,000 gas
PUSH 0x00
PUSH 0x00
SSTORE    ; free: -15,000 gas
```

---

# Gas and incentives

Miners are rewarded proportionally
to the amount of gas each transaction consumes.

* Transaction senders set a *gas price*
  * Amount of money/gas that the sender is ready to pay
  * Miners are incentivized to include transactions with higher gas price
* Miners receive gas used &times; gas price for each transaction in the mined block
  * If gas budget is not fully used, gas left is returned to sender
  * If execution fails, the gas used is not returned

# Ethereum Smart Contract Programming

---

# Solidity

* High-level language targeting the EVM
* Looks vaguely like JavaScript
* Strongly typed, with a fairly simple type-system
* Contains smart contract related primitives
* Supports multiple inheritance

---

# Solidity Example

```solidity
contract Coin {
  address public minter;
  mapping (address => uint) public balances;

  constructor() public { minter = msg.sender; }

  function mint(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(msg.sender == minter);
    require(amount < 1e60);
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }

  function send(address receiver, uint amount) public {
    require(amount <= balances[msg.sender]);
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[receiver] += amount;
  }
}
```

# Compiling Smart Contracts: functions

.pull-left-50[
* EVM bytecode has no concept of functions, only conditional jumps
* Solidity creates a conditional jump for each function
* Solidity uses function signatures to choose which function to call
* Transaction sent to the contract must contain the necessary data to trigger the function
]

.pull-right-50.small-margin.text.minor[
Sample signature
```solidity
claimFunds(address receiver)
```

Conditional jumps
```x86asm
CALLDATASIZE      ; load data size
ISZERO
PUSH2 0x00c4      ; default function location
JUMPI
CALLDATALOAD      ; load data
DUP1
PUSH4 0x24600fc3  ; function signature hash
EQ
PUSH2 0x00db      ; function location
JUMPI
DUP1
PUSH4 0x30b67baa
EQ
PUSH2 0x00e6
JUMPI
```
]

---

# Compiling Smart Contracts: types

* EVM only has 256 bit words
* Solidity has a simple type system including
  * integer types
  * data structures (lists, maps)
* Integer types are encoded using bitwise operations  
  e.g. `uint8`: `uint256 & 0xff`
* Data structures are encoded using hash  
  e.g. `key(list[5]) = keccak256(index(list) . 5)`

# Smart Contracts: What could go wrong?

.pull-left-50[
## TheDAO hack (2016)

.spaced-list[
* TheDAO raised *~$150M in ICO*
* Soon after, it got hacked *~$50M*
* Price of Ether halved
* Ethereum community decided to hard-fork
* Attacker used a *re-entrancy* vulnerability
]
]

.pull-left-50[
## Parity Wallet bug (2017)

.spaced-list[
* Parity wallet library was used to manage multisig wallet contracts
* Parity *wallet* has been *removed* due to a "bug"
* *Dependent contracts* became unable to send funds
* Around *$280M frozen*
]
]

---

# Common vulnerabilities / bugs

.spaced-list[
* Re-entrancy
  * Can allow an attacker to drain funds
* Unhandled exceptions
  * Can result in lost funds
* Dependency on destructed contract
  * Can result in locked funds
* Transaction order dependency
  * Can allow an attacker to manipulate prices
* Integer overflow
  * Can result in locked fund
]

---

# Re-entrancy

.pull-left-50[
* Vulnerable contract sends money before updating state

* Attacker contractâ€™s fallback function is called

* Attacker contract makes re-entrant call to attacker
]


.pull-right-50[
```solidity
function payMe(address account) public {
  uint amount = getAmount(account);
  // XXX: vulnerable
  if (!account.send(amount))
    throw;
  balance[account] -= amount;
}
```
.caption[

```solidity
function () {
  victim.payMe(owner);
}
```
.caption[

]

---

# Unhandled exception

.pull-left-50[
* In Solidity, not all failed "calls" raise an exception

* If the failed call returns a boolean, it must be checked correctly

* Failure to do this could result in inconsistent state or even locked funds
]

.pull-right-50[
.middle-block[
```solidity
// allows user to withdraw funds
function withdraw(address account) public {
  uint amount = getAmount(account);
  balance[account] -= amount;
  account.send(amount); // could silently fail
}
```
.caption[

]
]

---

# Dependency on destructed contract

.pull-left-40[
* Contracts can use other contracts as library

* If the library contract gets destructed, the call becomes a no-op

* If the only way for a contract to send money is to use the library,
Ether can be locked
]


.pull-right-60[
```solidity
function sendEther(address recipient,
                   uint value) public onlyOwner {
  address.send(value)
}
```

```solidity
address public library = 0xdcc703c0E500B653Ca82273B7BFAd8045D85a470;
function sendEther(address recipient, uint value) public {
  bytes4 sig =  bytes4(sha3("sendEther(address, uint)"));
  library.delegatecall(sig, recipient, value);
}
```
.caption[

# Transaction Order Dependency

.pull-left-50[
* Result can change depending on the order of the transactions

* Miners are free to choose the miner order of the transactions in a block

* There can be financial incentives to perform such manipulations
]

.pull-right-50[
```solidity
function solve() {
  if (msg.sender == owner) {// update reward
    owner.send(reward);
    reward = msg.value;
  } else if (puzzleSolved(msg.data)) {
    msg.sender.send(reward); //send reward
    solution = msg.data;
  }
}
```

# Integer Overflow

.pull-left-50[
.spaced-list[
* Solidity has many different numeric types
  * `int8` to `int256` and `uint8` to `uint256`
* Types are encoded in EVM using bit manipulations
  * If `a` is `uint8`, a `AND a 0xff` would be generated
* Variables may therefore overflow or underflow during execution
]
]

.pull-right-50[
.middle-block[
```solidity
function overflow(uint fee) {
  uint amount = 100;

  // underflows if fee > 100
  amount -= fee;

  // tries to send a large value
  // and fails on underflow
  msg.sender.send(amount);
}
```

* Work either on Solidity or on the EVM bytecode

* Check for known vulnerabilities/patterns

# What we will build

A simple token compliant with the [ERC-20 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20)

This is how most "coins" or "tokens" are implemented on Ethereum.
It defines a common interface to

* Transfer tokens
* Allow other parties to transfer tokens
* Check balance for tokens
* Emit events for token transfers

---

# ERC-20 interface

```solidity
// Returns the total supply of tokens
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)

// Returns the balance of `_owner`
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)

// Transfers `_value` from sender to `_to`
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

// Transfers `_value` from `_from` to `_to` if `_from` authorized the send
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

// Approves `_spender` to spend `_value` in behalf of the sender
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)

// Returns how much `_spender` is allowed to spend in behalf of `_owner`
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)

// Is emitted when `_from` transfers `_value` to `_to`
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
// Is emitted when `_owner` allows `_spender` to spend `_value` on his behalf
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

---

# Token specifics

We will build a very simple token:

* Fixed total supply (1,000,000 for the sake of example)
  * No tokens can be created or burned after creation
* All tokens belong to owner at contract creation time
* No other particular limitation

---

# Starting to develop

.small-margin[

Start a new project

```
mkdir my-token
cd my-token
truffle init
truffle create contract MyToken
```

Create migration file: .text.minor[`migrations/2_my_token.js`]

```javascript
const MyToken = artifacts.require("MyToken");

module.exports = function(deployer) {
  deployer.deploy(MyToken);
};
```
]

---

# Test project


.small-margin[

Download the specs for the project

```bash
wget https://git.io/smart-contract-intro-spec -O test/my-token-test.js
```

.small[&#9888; The specs were written by me, please complain if something does not look right]

Run the tests

```
truffle test
```

Get the contract skeleton (optional)  
.text.minor[If you are not confident, you can get the skeleton to get started]

```bash
wget https://git.io/smart-contract-intro-skeleton -O contracts/MyToken.sol
```

Now, implement the contract and run the tests regularly.
