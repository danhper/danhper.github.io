# Blockchain overview

.pull-left-40[
* Append-only data structures
* Unit-of-work is a block
* Each block has many transactions
* Each transaction can contain several actions
* Block producers (miners) need to reach consensus

# Blockchain scalability

* Scalability often discussed in terms of transactions per second
* Average transactions per second can be computed by <br>blocks/second x transactions/block


Platform   |  Block time     | Transactions/block | Transaction/second
:---------:|----------------:|-------------------:|------------------:
Visa       |               - |                  - |             65,000
Bitcoin    |      10 minutes |              3,500 |                  6
--

Tezos      |        1 minute |              2,400 |                 40
EOS      |      0.5 second |              2,000 |              4,000
XRP       |               ? |                  ? |             65,000

# EOS Throughput over time

.pull-left-40[
* Change of trend in November 2019
* Due to airdrop of EIDOS token
* Caused EOS to enter congestion mode
]

# EIDOS token aidrop

.pull-left-50[
* Very simple airdrop
  1. Send EOS to a contract
  2. Contract sends back the EOS and some amount of its token
* Originator of the airdrop is anonymous but tone is aggressive
  * Likely a voluntary spam attack
* Caused many developers to quit EOS

According to recent report, developers working on platform fell by 85%

# XRP Throughput over time

.pull-left-40[
* Dominated by `OfferCreate`
* Spike around November and December due to spam attack
* Stable throughput from January and on

# Value in XRP transactions

.pull-left-50[
* Less than *6%* of the transactions had an economic value
* Only 0.2% of the transactions were successful trades
* Only 3.3% of the transactions were payments with an economic value
]

# Takeaways

* All three blockchains are still very far from their potential
  * Current TPS very far away from claimed maximum
  * Most transactions are have no economic value
      * *96%* of EOS transactions from valueless airdrop token
      * *76%* of Tezos transactions to maintain consensus
      * *94%* of XRP transactions have no economic value
* Low or absent fees tend to attract a lot of spam
  * XRP has dealt with spam attacks much better than EOS, likely because of the difference in fee model
