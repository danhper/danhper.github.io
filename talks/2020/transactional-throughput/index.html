.pull-left-40[
* Append-only data structures
* Unit-of-work is a block
* Each block has many transactions
* Each transaction can contain several actions
* Block producers (miners) need to reach consensus

# Blockchain scalability

* Scalability often discussed in terms of transactions per second
* Average transactions per second can be computed by <br>blocks/second x transactions/block


Platform   |  Block time     | Transactions/block | Transaction/second
:---------:|----------------:|-------------------:|------------------:
Visa       |               - |                  - |             65,000
Bitcoin    |      10 minutes |              3,500 |                  6
--

Tezos      |        1 minute |              2,400 |                 40
EOS      |      0.5 second |              2,000 |              4,000
XRP       |               ? |                  ? |             65,000

# EOS results

# EOS Throughput over time

.pull-left-40[
* Change of trend in November 2019
* Due to airdrop of EIDOS token
* Caused EOS to enter congestion mode
]

.pull-right-60[

# EIDOS token aidrop

.pull-left-50[
* Very simple airdrop
  1. Send EOS to a contract
  2. Contract sends back the EOS and some amount of its token
* Originator of the airdrop is anonymous but tone is aggressive
  * Likely a voluntary spam attack
* Caused many developers to quit EOS

According to recent report, developers working on platform fell by 85%

# EOS Throughput before spam attack

.pull-left-40[
* Used a lot for betting games
* Used for some porn website payments
* Fairly stable and varied usage

# Wash-trading on EOS

* WhaleEx was most active exchange at time of analysis
* Claims to be the largest decentralized exchange in the world
* In *75%* of the trades, the buyer and seller were the same user
* The exact same amount was sent back-and-forth
* Aggregated trades for all top users resulted in 0 value transfer

# Tezos results

# Tezos Throughput over time

.pull-left-40[
* Very stable trend
* Vastly dominated by endorsement - consensus related
* Regular spikes in number of transactions
* Transaction spikes due to block producer payouts - consensus related

# XRP Throughput over time

.pull-left-40[
* Dominate by `OfferCreate`
* Spike around November and December due to spam attack
* Regular spikes in number of transactions
* Transaction spikes due to block producer payouts - consensus related
]

.pull-right-60[

# I Owe You (IOU) in XRP

.pull-left-50[
* Anybody can emit an IOU
* User can establish trust line to accept IOUs from other users
* If the IOU issuer cannot pay, the IOU has no value

# Value in XRP transactions

.pull-left-50[
* Less than *6%* of the transactions had an economic value
* Only 0.2% of the transactions were successful trades
* Only 3.3% of the transactions were payments with an economic value

# Valuable payments on XRP


.pull-left-40[
* Vast majority of valuable payments are in XRP
* Average of 586 million XRP traded per day
* Exchanges account for a large portion of these payments

# Takeaways

* All three blockchains are still very far from their potential
  * Current TPS very far away from claimed maximum
  * Most transactions are have no economic value
      * *96%* of EOS transactions from valueless airdrop token
      * *76%* of Tezos transactions to maintain consensus
      * *94%* of XRP transactions have no economic value
* Low or absent fees tend to attract a lot of spam
  * XRP has dealt with spam attacks much better than EOS, likely because of the difference in fee model
