* Protocol that intermediates funds between users
* Unlike peer-to-peer lending, funds are pooled

# Liquidation risk

.pull-left-50[
* `COMP` launch has changed users' behavior
* Before launch, almost all users were at least 25% over their minimum collateral threshold
* After launch, more than 40% of the users were within 5%

# Price fluctuation and liquidation risk

.pull-left-50[
* Users rely on DAI being stable
* Small variations in DAI price can create large liquidations:
  3% price change would have made more than 10M USD liquidable
* This happened last November: over 88M USD liquidated

# Takeaways

* Governance token has changed PLF users' behavior significantly
  * A lot of liquidity was attracted but users are taking more and more risks
* Users tend to underestimate the volatility of stable coins
  * Small price deviations can lead to large liquidations
  * Large amounts were liquidated last November
* Liquidators are becoming more efficient
  * More than 70% of the liquidations happen in the block where positions became liquidable
