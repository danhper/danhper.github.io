# Background

---

# Smart contracts

.pull-left-50[
* Programs deployed on a blockchain
* Usually written in a high-level language and compiled into bytecode
* Interacted with using transactions
* Uses some metering mechanism
]

.pull-right-50[

# On-chain building blocks

.pull-left-50[
  ## Oracles

  * Facilitate on-chain access to external information
  * Implemented as smart contracts being regularly updated
  * Often require some level of trust
]

.pull-right-50[
  ## Stablecoins

  * Assets of which the price is pegged to a currency (e.g. USD)
  * Can be implemented in very different ways (e.g. custodial vs non-custodial)
  * Movements above/below target are not uncommon

# Protocols for Loanable Funds (PLF)

* Protocol that intermediates funds between users
* Unlike peer-to-peer lending, funds are pooled
* Requires users to deposit collateral

.text-center[
![Protocols for Lonable Funds overview](./plf.png)
.caption[Protocols for Lonable Funds overview]
]

---

# PLF building blocks

* Interest rate models: some function(s) taking liquidity as an argument and returning an interest rate
* Collaterization: deposit that can be sold off to recover the debt of an defaulted position
* Liquidations: the process of selling a borrower’s collateral to recover the debt value upon default
* Governance Mechanism: decentralized governance typically achieved through a ERC-20 governance token, where token holders' votes are in proportion to their stake

---

# PLF use cases

* Earning interest: Liquidity providers of funds are incentivized by accrued interest
* Leveraged short position: Borrowing funds of an asset expected to depreciate in value
* Leveraged long position: Increasing exposure to an asset expected to appreciate in value
* Liquidity mining: PLFs may distribute governance tokens to their users to incentivize liquidity providers and/or borrowers

# Model and methodology

---

# PLF definitions

* *Market* A smart contract acting as the intermediary of loanable funds for a particular cryptoasset, where users supply and borrow funds.
* *Supply* Funds deposited to a market that can be loaned out to other users and used as collateral against depositors’ own borrow positions.
* *Borrow* Funds loaned out to users of a market.
* *Collateral* Funds available to back a user’s aggregate borrow positions.
* *Locked funds* Funds remaining in the PLF smart contracts, equal to the difference between supplied and borrowed funds.

---

# Agents in the system

* *Supplier* A user who deposits funds to a market.
* *Borrower* A user who borrows funds from a market. Since a borrow position must be collateralized by deposited funds, a borrower must also be a supplier.
* *Liquidator* A user who purchases a borrower’s supply in a market when the borrower’s collateral to borrow ratio falls below some threshold.

---

# Conditions for liquidation

* All markets have a *collateral factor*, the ratio between supply and collateral funds
* When computing collateral and borrowed funds across markets, amounts are converted to a common currency, e.g. USD or ETH
* A user is liquidable if the *sum of his borrows exceeds the sum of his collateral* across all markets


---

# Leveraging on PLFs

.pull-left-50[
## Example steps for leveraging

1. Supply ETH on a PLF.
2. Leverage the deposited ETH to borrow DAI.
3. Sell the purchased DAI for ETH.
4. Repeat steps 1 to 3 as desired.

# Analyzing Compound

We analyze the different events emitted by Compound smart contracts

.center-block.max-content[
Event     | Description           | State change
----------|-----------------------|-------------
Borrow    | New borrow is created | Borrow
Mint      | cTokens minted for deposit | Supply
RepayBorrow | Borrow is partially/fully repaid | Borrow
LiquidateBorrow | Borrow is liquidated | Supply & Borrow
Redeem | cTokens are used to redeem deposit of asset | Supply

# Borrowers and suppliers

Sharp increase when `COMP` rewards started to be distributed

# Distribution of funds

.pull-left-50[
 Top user accounts for 27.4%; top 10 users account for 49%

# Leveraging spirals

* Leveraging spirals is an important reason for concentration in top borrowers/suppliers
* Analysis of the top account
  * Provided in total 55M USD to the protocol
  * Used spirals to supply 342M USD and borrowed 247M
* Analysis of all accounts
  * Over 2,100 accounts (40% of total number borrowers) use leveraging spirals
  * Over 600M USD (~50% of the total supply) is supplied using spirals

---

# Liquidation risk

.pull-left-50[
* `COMP` launch has changed users behavior
* Before launch, almost all users were at least 25% over their minimum collateral threshold
* After launch, more than 40% of the users were within 5%
]

# Price fluctuation and liquidation risk

.pull-left-50[
* Users rely on DAI being stable
* Small variations in DAI price can create large liquidations:
  3% price change would have made more than 10M USD liquidable
* This happened last November: over 88M USD liquidated
]

# Liquidations and liquidators

Both liquidated amount and liquidation efficiency has increased with time

# Takeaways

---

# Takeaways

* Governance token has changed PLF users' behavior significantly
  * A lot of liquidity was attracted but users are taking more and more risks
* Users tend to underestimate the volatility of stable coins
  * Small price deviations can lead to large liquidations
  * Large amounts were liquidated last November
* Liquidators are becoming more efficient
  * More than 70% of the liquidations happen in the block where positions became liquidable
