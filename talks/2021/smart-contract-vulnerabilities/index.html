# Ethereum Smart Contracts

.pull-left-50[
.spaced-list[
* Programs deployed on the Ethereum blockchain
* Usually written in Solidity, compiled into EVM bytecode
* Can transfer money to other addresses (including contracts)
* Each instruction execution consumes gas
]
]

# Smart Contracts: What could go wrong?

.pull-left-50[
## TheDAO hack (2016)

.spaced-list[
* TheDAO raised *~$150M in ICO*
* Soon after, it got hacked *~$50M*
* Price of Ether halved
* Ethereum community decided to hard-fork
* Attacker used a *re-entrancy* vulnerability
]
]

.pull-left-50[
## Parity Wallet bug (2017)

.spaced-list[
* Parity wallet library was used to manage multisig wallet contracts
* Parity *wallet* has been *removed* due to a "bug"
* *Dependent contracts* became unable to send funds
* Around *$280M frozen*
]
]

---

# Common vulnerabilities / bugs

* *Reentrancy* can allow an attacker to drain funds
* *Unhandled exceptions*: can result in lost funds
* *Dependency on destructed contract*: can result in locked funds
* *Transaction order dependency*: can allow an attacker to manipulate prices
* *Integer overflow* can result in locked fund
* *Unrestricted action* can result in an attacker stealing or locking funds

---

# Smart Contract analysis tools

.pull-left-40[
* Usually static analysis and/or symbolic execution

* Work either on Solidity or on the EVM bytecode

* Check for known vulnerabilities/patterns
]

# Smart Contract exploitation

.pull-left-50[
## According to analysis tools

* Thousands of vulnerable contracts

* Hundreds of millions USD at risk
]

.pull-right-50[
## In the real-world

* TheDAO and Parity wallet bug were impressive

* Otherwise, a few attacks here and there
]

<br>

â‡’ We analyze the Ethereum blockchain to look for *actual exploitation*

# Dataset

.pull-left-40[
* Data received from the paper authors

* Received replies from 5 out of 8 of the authors we contacted

* Ether at stake computed at time of the report

# Detection overview

.pull-left-40[
1. Retrieve all transactions

2. Retrieve execution traces for all transactions

3. Encode execution traces to Datalog

4. Query Datalog for vulnerabilities

# Checking for re-entrancy

.pull-left-50[
1. Record all calls

2. Check for mutually recursive calls between contracts

<br>
```prolog
call_flow(A, B) :- call(A, B).
call_flow(A, B) :- call(A, C), call_flow(C, B).
reentrant_call(A, B) :- call_flow(A, B),
                        call_flow(B, A),
                        A != B.
```

  uint amount = getAmount(account);
  // XXX: vulnerable

# Checking for unhandled exceptions

.pull-left-50[
1. Record all call results
  * Top value on the stack after a call

2. Check if the return value is used in a condition (`JUMPI`)

```prolog
influences_condition(A) :- used_in_condition(A).
influences_condition(A) :-
  depends(B, A), used_in_condition(B).

unhandled_exception(A) :-
  failed_call(A), ~influences_condition(A).
```

  balance[account] -= amount;
  account.send(amount); // could silently fail
}
```

# Checking for integer overflow

.pull-left-50[
1. Infer variable types from bytecode
   * `SIGNEXTEND` means the variable is signed
   * `AND n 0xff` means it is a `uint8`
2. Compare typed and untyped results

.italic[The approach can lead to some false-positives]

In total, *at most 0.27%* of the 3M Ether at stake has been *exploited*

# Takeaways

* **Re-entrancy** seems to be the *most dangerous* issue. Good target for static analysis. Better prevention at the EVM level could be helpful.

* **Unhandled exceptions** are *handled well enough* by current tooling.

* **Dependency on destructed contract** is mostly a *non-issue*.

* **Transactions order dependency** does *not* seem to be *used to steal ETH* directly.

* **Integer overflow** is hard to prevent and consequences *hard to predict*. Also good target for static analysis.

# Contracts wealth distribution

.pull-left-50[
* Combined value: *~2 million ETH*

* Only *~2,000* out of 23,327 contracts *held Ether*

* Less than 100 contracts had more than 10 Ether

* The *top 6 contracts held 83%* of the total Ether

# Vulnerable but not exploitable

.pull-left-50[
* Many cases where "vulnerable" contracts are not exploitable

* High-value contracts flagged vulnerable are typically not exploitable

* Usually limitation due to the nature of static analysis
]

.pull-right-50[
```solidity
function removeOwner(address owner) onlyWallet {
  isOwner[owner] = false;
  // Could in Theory run out of gas
  for (uint i=0; i<owners.length - 1; i++) {
    if (owners[i] == owner) {
      owners[i] = owners[owners.length - 1];
      break;
    }
  }
  // a bit more logic
}

# Summary

* Analyzed 23k contracts with *3M Ether at risk*

* *At most 0.27%* of this Ether, less than 10k ETH, was *exploited*

* Overall, *high-value contracts* seem to be *secure*
